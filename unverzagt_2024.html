							<h1>Enactments of knowledge and social order in participatory modelling: an ethnographic perspective on the relationship between science and democracy</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This ethnographic project aimed to inquire into the relationship between science and democracy. It does so by constructing a praxiographic perspective on participatory modelling, a knowledge production practice in sustainability research. Researchers in general and STS scholars in particular increasingly advocate for participatory research. Often, proponents suggest a link to democracy. Yet, despite Science Studies’ foundational assumptions on the situatedness and performativity of knowledge and the interweaving of science and social order, STS scholars have continued to uphold a separation between engagement methods and more technical aspects of participatory research projects when reflecting on democracy. Participatory modellers, meanwhile, often similarly maintain a separation between knowledge, reality, and values when demanding more participation in the construction of models. STS scholars have also, on the other hand, argued that science and social order are ‘co-produced’. Yet, this type of argument usually provides no middle-range theory that allows for empirical research on the relationship between science and democracy. In this thesis, I therefore explore in how far the means of Science Studies, brought into conversation with political theory, ethics, philosophy of science, anthropology and sustainability research can facilitate an empirically grounded story on the relationship between science and social order. I offer an ethnographic story about participatory modelling in sustainability research which suggests that science might relate to social order, and therefore democracy, because research practices enact specific versions of the ‘multiple objects’ world, knowledge, science, people, and ethics. To tell this story, I trace enactments through two participatory modelling projects in which I have done ethnographic field work. I describe research practices such as selecting interviewees, building conceptual models, generalising from data, and simulation modelling. Along a narration of the participatory research process, I present analytical considerations which suggest that a range of seemingly technical research practices enact different versions of knowledge and social order. To identify ‘difference’, I link ethnographic descriptions to existing conceptualisations of my key ‘objects’ enacted through, for example, democratic theory, philosophy of science, and ethics. The resulting account suggests that different practices which researchers might engage in over the course of a research project can enact different versions of world, people, knowledge, science, and ethics. These enactments, however, seem to hang together, pointing to the worldmaking dimension of research. Moreover, I reflect on the way in which the same research practice brings forth enactments of different objects, for instance knowledge and ethics, which also hang together. To turn my reflection productive for doing research and participatory modelling, I end each empirical chapter on some tentative propositions for alternative practices and corresponding enactments. I lay out, for example, which conceptual model-building practices might enact a version of ethics that evokes utilitarianism, meritocratic utilitarianism, deontology, discourse ethics, the Capability Approach to Justice, or care ethics. Ultimately, this study contributes to developing a more empirically grounded approach to reflecting on the relationship between science and democracy. I try out a methodology that combines praxiography and ethnographic analysis to unbracket the link between participation in science and democracy. Secondly, taking on this perspective, I contribute to debates in STS and in the modelling community. I argue that participatory modelling can link to democracy, alongside the production of specific versions of knowledge, people, and ethics. Yet it does not necessarily do so. Over the course of one participatory research project, different research practices might furthermore enact several different versions of social order. Modellers, just as other researchers, might therefore need to engage in a conscious reflection not only on how to implement participatory processes or the engagement part of a research project. Researchers might have to reflexively engage in research practices that enact versions of social order which they want to help bring into being. Lastly, a praxiographic perspective on democracy suggests that different research practices, which enact various democratic versions of social order, might need to co-exist in a space of agonistic pluralism.</p>
